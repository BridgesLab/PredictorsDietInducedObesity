This script was most recently run on `r date()`. 

```{r process_cohort5_6_data, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
previous_cohort_file <- "../data/processed/fasting_weights_file.csv"
prev_cohort_data <- read.csv(previous_cohort_file)


```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
