Data Analysis Code
===================

These analyses were all run using R within its IDE RStudio.  These can be obtained from the following locations:

* **R**: http://cran.us.r-project.org/
* **RStudio**: https://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/

These scripts can be run or modified and re-run by opening the file with the Rmd extension from RStudio.  Clicking knit HTML will generate the md and html files along with all the figures and update the statistics.  These scripts in general pull in data from the */data* folder and save images in the *scripts/figures* directory
