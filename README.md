Script files
--------------

This code base includes the raw data and reproducible R code for these analyses within the **scripts** folder.  All analysis file are R scripts as Rmarkdown (Rmd) files.  These files can be run inside RStudio https://www.rstudio.com/ and will generate the md and html files which include the processed data.  For more information on using R and using these files see http://cran.us.r-project.org/.
