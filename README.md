Raw Data
----------

All raw data is in the **data/raw** folder.  This data is automatically obtained from our internal LIMS system and can only be updated from that point.  The script files use this raw data to do the analysis.  Data which has been processed is saved in the **data/processed** folder.

Script files
--------------

This code base includes the raw data and reproducible R code for these analyses within the **scripts** folder.  All analysis file are R scripts as Rmarkdown (Rmd) files.  These files can be run inside RStudio https://www.rstudio.com/ and will generate the md and html files which include the processed data.  For more information on using R and using these files see http://cran.us.r-project.org/.

Publications
-------------

All posters, manuscripts or external presentations are in the **publications** folder.  This includes revisions, and where possible reviewer comments and responses.

A preprint of the manuscript from this study is available on bioRxiv at http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/004283
